Start the game
Each turn you have four different options; 
1) light attack
2) heavy attack
3) special attack
4) switch element

   Light and Heavy attack do a random amount of damage depending on a preset interval and which element you have selected. Light attacks cost 5 stamina,and the Heavy attacks cost 10 stamina

   Special attack do not do damage, they give you a certain buff depending on what element you have selected, If you have the air element selected it gives you a stamina boost, If you have water selected it heals you, if you have fire selected it gives you a damage buff, and if you have earth selected it gives you a defensive buff. Special attacks cost 20 stamina

   Switching elements will help you defeat certain bosses. For example, if you have facing the Fire Lord it would be smart to select water if possible because water attacks have a 1.5 damage modifier on fire enemies. Experiment with different elements to figure out the ultimate strategy!!!
